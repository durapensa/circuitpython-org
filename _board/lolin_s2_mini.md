### Flashing UF2 Bootloader

***Important***: *this will erase previously flashed firmware & sketches from the board, but needs to be perfomed only once.*

- Download the latest `tinyuf2-lolin_s2_mini-......zip` from [TinyUF2 releases](https://github.com/adafruit/tinyuf2/releases),
    - Unzip to find the file `combined.bin`.
- Place board in bootloader mode:
    - Plug board into a USB port on your computer using a data/sync cable. Make sure it is the only board plugged in, and that a charge-only cable is not being used.
    - Press and hold the `0` button down. Don't let go of it yet!
    - Press and release the `RST` button. You should have the `0` button pressed while you do this.
    - Release the `0` button.
- Use the Adafruit WebSerial ESPTool to upload `combined.bin` (Google Chrome 89 or newer):
    - Open a new web browser window or tab to the [Adafruit WebSerial ESPTool](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/).
    - Select `460800 Baud` from the pull-down menu at the top-right of the page.
    - Click the `Connect` button at the top-right of the page.
    - Select the COM or Serial port from the pop-up window.
    - After successful connection, click the `Erase` button.
    - After successful erase, click the first `Choose a file...` button, locate the `combined.bin` file unzipped earlier, click `Ok`.
    - After successfully choosing the `combined.bin` file, click the `Program` button.
    - After the TinyUF2 firmware update is complete, press the `RST` button on the board. A new drive `S2MINIBOOT` should be visible in your file browser.

### Flashing CircuitPython

- Flash the UF2 bootloader using the instructions above.
- Download the `.UF2` file from this page.
- In your file browser, Drag & Drop the `.UF2` file to the `S2MINIBOOT` drive.
- Your board should reboot automatically into CircuitPython. The `S2MINIBOOT` drive should disappear and be replaced with a new drive `CIRCUITPY`.
